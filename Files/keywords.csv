cough,Ascof Forte,Ambroxol,"Lagundi has become one of the most established and widely used herbal drugs for cough in the country through the various measures 
taken to promote research and development of traditional medicine. The lagundi-based medication was first licensed by PCHRD to three 
pharmaceutical companies in 1995 namely, Pascual Laboratories, Inc., Gruppo Medica, Inc. and Natrapharm, Inc.

The technology has been fully commercialized since 1997 by Pascual Laboratories, which released lagundi in the market under the brand 
name Ascof Lagundi. In accordance with the Technology Transfer Act of 2009, PCHRD then transferred the entitlement of the technology to 
UP Manila on behalf of the National Integrated Research Program on Medicinal Plants (NIRPROMP) in 2012.",https://www.pchrd.dost.gov.ph/heartnovation/lagundi-anti-cough-and-anti-asthma-medicine/

Biogesic is a trusted brand of paracetamol, Paracetamol (Biogesic) is a medication that is typically used to relieve mild to moderate pain.

it gives relief for most people, even for children, breastfeeding and/or pregnant women, and the elderly. Biogesic (Paracetamol) 
exhibits analgesic and antipyretic activity by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. It produces analgesia by elevating the pain 
threshold and antipyresis through action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center.

Like other NSAIDs, Ibuprofen works by changing the body’s chemical response to pain, swelling and fever resulting in relief of 
symptoms of inflammation (e.g., swelling, redness) and relief of pain and/or fever. Ibuprofen given as a softgel capsule is absorbed 
more rapidly by the body compared to an ordinary tablet.

weak immunity,Fern-C,"Ceelin Plus, Myrevit-C","FERN C contains sodium ascorbate, a form of Vitamin C that is more readily absorbed (up to 95% according to the US National Institutes of 
Health) by the body. The better absorption of a nutrient is, the more effective it becomes. And since it comes in capsule form, FERN C 
eliminates the need to use starch binders that reduce absorption and efficacy of vitamins. Since FERN-C is alkaline-based, a person who 
takes it neither feels bloated nor experiences intestinal and gastric irritation. It is also an all-natural vitamin C made from crystallized
powder that preserves the vitamin’s effectiveness and pureness. It is easily dissolved and absorbed by the body. Fern-C is given the Quali-C 
trademark of DSM Nutritionals. Quali-C is a seal of quality, reliability, and traceability in the manufacture of this non-acidic vitamin C,
